About HireArt
 HireArt is building the first full-stack platform for businesses to source, employ, and manage contract W-2 employees. Our employment platform is the world’s first fully-featured HRIS for the contract W-2 workforce, a massive and growing segment of the labor market. We combine hiring and employment in a single platform, creating a magical experience for businesses: search, interview, make offers, and manage workers, all in one place. Once on board, HireArt provides contract workers with a caring home base that comes with all of the benefits & support associated with permanent employment.  Our goal is to enable businesses to focus on the people who make up their workforce, instead of the tools to manage it. That's why we've developed a transparent and simple to use end-to-end platform that provides contract work opportunities with the security and stability of traditional W-2 employment while still giving businesses the flexibility they need to scale their workforces.
